# PARIS 2

## my return to Paris was much more enjoyable
This time I studied a bit more before going. I was sober. I was boxing. I took boxing group classes about a mile away from my apartment from an english speaking instructor. I got to meet up with Henry and make new friends. I was learning about where life could take me and seriously considered renting an apartment there - but I had more cities to visit first before I decided. 

On this trip I was staying on rue des Saint Denis again, but on the southern side of the arch in a brothel filled with 50 year-old prostitutes. Fifi would knock on my door and ask if I could buy her Marlboros at the tabac down the street. They would take Sundays off and drink in their pajamas with the door open. 

One night it was one of their birthdays and I was invited. The apartment was tiny and we drank shoulder to shoulder and had camembert au miel, canard gratin, and chocolate torte. One of the prostitutes blacked out singing over the Grease soundtrack in broken english and knocked over the TV stand that held everyone's drinks twice. 

In France prostitutes like to have their dignity - no photographs. I'll always remember them and usually pass by when I visit to see who's around
