# KENTUCKY

## my grandpa was born and died in kentucky
he was my role model. he loved organic foods but would only eat skippy peanut butter. very opinionated and didn't take any shit but was kind about it. he fixed up and sold over 180 cars and flipped about 140 houses in his lifetime. his work made him a millionaire. we would drink moonshine he got as payment from locals. he impressed a great deal into my mind.
