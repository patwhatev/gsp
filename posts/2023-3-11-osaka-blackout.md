# OSAKA BLACKOUT

## working graveyard in osaka is hard
you start work at 11pm and work until 7am - whispering in meetings with very little light or energy. eating over the night hours is weird and it's hard to find healthy food to eat cheaply in japan that you can prepare at home. 

one night i went out on a mission to get fucked up. there are no drugs in japan so you have to drink. there is more yakuza in osaka, but the prices make it not worth pursuing. one night i ended up in a basement party and met a punk schoolboy who was also into taking photos. i blacked out within the first few minutes of meeting him but it seems we took a bunch of photos together.

the next thing i remember it is daytime and i am walking trying to find my house - but i'm walking in the wrong direction. i keep wandering around thinking about stealing a bike, but they're all locked up. i found a shrine and prayed for a better life
