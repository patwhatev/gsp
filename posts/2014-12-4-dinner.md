# DINNER 

## We walked into my great uncle Wilbert's house at around 4:30 PM
Immediately after walking in you could see a body wrapped in blue blankets on a tarp it was my grandma. There were chairs all around and lots of food we sat vigil until the elders came people brought offerings of baskets. some had Doritos in them. The women stood around the body and held a curtain up as the women elders took her out of the body bag and washed her body. They then put her in a native dress. One of the elders of the Golden Eagle clan came and blessed my grandmother he unfolded a Dr Pepper and Dallas Cowboys handkerchief and pulled out three feathers and put them in her hand and pulled out a blanket from a Walmart bag and wrapped her in it and covered her face with the green silk handkerchief. There was a mentally handicapped native woman chanting in the corner all eight of them gathered and sang songs for two hours to guide her soul back home there was laughter we ate food it was like Christmas except my grandma was laying on the ground dead and wrapped in blankets
