# WAKING LIFE - 10 YEAR REVIEW

##  i remember seeing waking life i was ten years younger
in college for the second time at 20 years old i used to watch this movie every night and take notes of my dreams read books about better dreaming and test myself i watched this movie after i got a minor in possesion of alcohol i went to this party justice was playing it was a kegger i spit in this girls drink someone gave me a ride somewhere i got out and slammed the car door the lights were black and yellow i walked into the darkness and woke up in multiple places - sometimes blackberry brambles and other times backyards of other people's homes. but i watched that movie after and it calmed me down
